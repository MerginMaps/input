# Code formatting

We are using `astyle` to format CPP and Objective-C files.
Format is similar to what QGIS have.

We also use software [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically check format when doing a commit.
You need to install it via `brew`/`pip`, see [installation details](https://pre-commit.com/#installation).

In order to start using the `pre-commit`, run `pre-commit install` in the repository root folder.

To manually run the style check, run `pre-commit run --all-files` or optionally run script `format_cpp.sh` (we use this one in CI currently).

In case you want to skip execution of pre-commit hooks, add additional flag `--no-verify` to your commit command, e.g.: `git commit -m "nit" --no-verify`
