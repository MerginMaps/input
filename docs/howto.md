## iOS dist certificates

1. Create new iOS distribution certificate
- open Keychain Access -> Certificate Assistant -> Request certificate (see https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devbfa00fef7)
   - User email: peter.petrik@lutraconsulting.co.uk
   - Common name: LUTRA CONSULTING LIMITED
   - CA email: None
      - Request is: Saved to disk
  -> creates `CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest` file
- click + on https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list and create new iOS Distribution Certificate
- Download it (`ios_distribution.cer`) and double click to open in Keychain Access
- In Keychain Access, right click and export p12 file (`iPhone Distribution: LUTRA CONSULTING LIMITED (xxxxxxxxx)`), with passport (IOS_CERT_KEY). You need to have it imported to "login" or personal space to be able to export p12 file.
- Store request and cer file, p12 in passbolt.lutraconsulting.co.uk (files in google drive in PP's MerginMaps/dev folder)

2. Create/Update provisioning profile
- Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles
- Edit LutraConsultingLtd.Input.AppStore and assign the certificate generated in 1.
- Download the `LutraConsultingLtdInputAppStore.mobileprovision`

3. Encrypt the files for GitHub
- Create IOS_GPG_KEY
- install gpg `brew install gnupg`
- Encrypt p12 file with command (use space in front of command to not end up in history!) ` gpg --symmetric --batch --passphrase="<IOS_GPG_KEY>" --output ./Certificates_ios_dist.p12.gpg ./Certificates.p12`
- Encrypt mobileprovision file with command ` gpg --symmetric --batch --passphrase="<IOS_GPG_KEY>" --output ./LutraConsultingLtdInputAppStore.mobileprovision.gpg ./LutraConsultingLtdInputAppStore.mobileprovision`
- Copy both files to `.github/secrets/ios`
- Update secret (passports) on github
